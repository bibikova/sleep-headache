# sleep-headache
Personal health project 
The aim of the project is to analyse sleep patterns and find out if it might cause headaches (migraines).

The hypothesis of my osteopath is that length of the deep sleep (in hours/minutes) if long enough might cause neck muscles to spasm which in its turn causes the headache. If this hypothesis is correct, next step can be finding out the length. 

The data about length of sleep as well as phases of sleep will be collected via Sleep Better app which is then integrated with Apple health and then downloaded via SQ access app. The data about headache - basically if it happens or not, possibly length and strength as additional parameters - will be added manually.  

Data supposed to be exported from the app in .csv format and processed in Python.
